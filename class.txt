pow(x,y)  => returns x^y

pow(2,3) => 8

running time => O(logn) Base = 2



sqrt:

sqrt(n) => returns a double value : square root of n

running time => O(root(n))


cbrt:
cbrt(n) => returns a double value : cube root of n


ceil:

ceil(n) => round up

n = 4.3 => ceil(n) = 5

floor:

floor(n) => round down

n = 4.3 => floor(n) = 4

round:

round(n) => round to nearest value 

n = 4.3 => 4
n = 4.5 => 5
n = 4.7 => 5

Check the digits after decimal point: If the digit is less than 5, then it will round down.
Otherwise it will round up.

Trunc:

trunc(n) => round down



min:

min(x,y) => minimum of x and y

max:

max(x,y) => maximum of x and y


popcount:

popcount(n) => returns a integer value : number of set bits in the binary representation of the number

n = 5 => binary : 101 => 2 set bits
n = 7 => binary : 111 => 3 set bits
n = 2 => binary : 10 => 1 set bits






OOP:

A school: 
 Many students

 array => store roll numbers of students 
 array => store names of students
